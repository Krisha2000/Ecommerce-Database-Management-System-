# Ecommerce Database Management System

This project is developed as part of the curriculum for the Database Management Systems (DBMS) course at Punjab Technical University (PTU). It demonstrates the design and implementation of a comprehensive e-commerce database using PostgreSQL. The project replicates core functionalities of an online shopping platform by managing data related to customers, products, sellers, orders, payments, reviews, and more.

The system is designed to help small businesses transition from offline to online commerce through a reliable, scalable, and consistent relational database solution. It implements relational modeling, normalized schema design, data integrity constraints, transactions, and advanced SQL functionalities such as triggers and stored procedures.

## Project Overview

In todayâ€™s digital economy, e-commerce has become a crucial component for business growth. The primary objective of this project is to develop a fully functional and normalized e-commerce database system that supports business operations such as product browsing, customer orders, payment tracking, and inventory management.

This database system is optimized for small to medium-scale enterprises and ensures data accuracy, security, and ease of querying. It serves both customers and sellers with isolated access roles and supports analytical queries for business decision-making.

Each entity is designed using best practices in relational schema design with appropriate constraints, keys, and normalization.

An ER diagram (not included here) illustrates the relationships, cardinalities, and participation types among entities.
